# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The r squared value is how accurate your line of best fit is to the data on the graph.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

For somebody who is 43 years old, the predicted blood pressure is around 137.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I would not say that this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's bood pressure for a few reasons. The first is because this model was made by high school students and not medical professionals, and the second is because blood pressure is not solely predicted by age and can also be affected by other factors such as diet, meaning a linear model would not be effective.
