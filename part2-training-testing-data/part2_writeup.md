## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective because it gives us more data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells you how accurate the data is to the model.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that this model is somewhat accurate. When compared to the American Heart Association's chart, it definetly is not as accurate, but that is to be expected.
