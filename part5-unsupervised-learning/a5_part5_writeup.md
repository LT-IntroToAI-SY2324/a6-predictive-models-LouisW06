# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

I would probably name the groups "Going broke", "Being cheap", "normal people", "modest rich", and "The Millionaires".

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

Probably either "Normal people" or "modest rich". If it were "modest rich" it would be at the cheaper end of annual income for that group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

Looking at the "Going broke" section. It is clear that these people spend a lot without having a large income. Since they buy so many things, a video advertisement that poses my product as the hit new thing would probably convince them to buy it.
